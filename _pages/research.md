My research spans two main areas: developing methodological tools for
causal inference and examining the dynamics of political instability and
regime change. Methodologically, I focus on incorporating
spatial-temporal interdependence into causal frameworks to address
challenges in studying political phenomena. Substantively, my work
explores the consequences of rare and transformative events, such as
failed coups, democratic breakdown, and the responses of citizens to
political polarization and instability.

Below are my current working papers, which bridge these methodological
and substantive interests. Each project contributes to advancing our
understanding of political instability and its far-reaching effects on
regimes and societies.
