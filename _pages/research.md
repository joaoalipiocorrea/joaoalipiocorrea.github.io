My research spans two main areas: developing tools for causal inference under violations of common assumptions and examining the dynamics of political instability and regime change.

My current methodological projects focus on causal inference under interference. I adapt and evaluate design-based and model-based strategies to recover credible effects when treatments diffuse across geographic or networked units, or when they evolve over time.

All my working papers are available upon request. Feel free to email me if you are interested in collaborating or just curious.
