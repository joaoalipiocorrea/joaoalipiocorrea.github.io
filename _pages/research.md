My current research focus on developing tools for causal inference under violations of common assumptions. In the projects listed below I adapt and evaluate design and model-based strategies to recover credible effects when treatments diffuse across networked units, or when they evolve over time.

All my working papers are available upon request. Feel free to email me if you are interested in collaborating or just curious.


# Methods

### **Synthetic Control Method under Interference: Detecting and Correcting Bias**  
*Working Paper*

<p style="font-size: 0.9em; color: #666;">
This paper develops formal tools to detect and correct bias in synthetic control estimators when spillovers contaminate the donor pool. I derive sufficient conditions for exposure dominance and propose diagnostics that identify violated support constraints.
