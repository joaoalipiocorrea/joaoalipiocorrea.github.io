See the extended slide deck for my PolMeth XLII poster [here](/files/polmeth25.pdf).

I am Joao Alipio-Correa, a second-year PhD student in Political Science and an MA student in Statistics at the University of Pittsburgh. My research centers on causal inference, with a focus on settings where standard assumptions, such as no interference between units, are unlikely to hold. I develop methods that account for spatial and temporal dependence, particularly in designs like synthetic control and difference-in-differences.

Beyond methodology, my applied work explores how regimes respond to stress. I study the political consequences of instability, with an emphasis on how sharp, acute events reshape political systems.
