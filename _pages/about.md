**See the extended slide deck for my Data Science Frontiers: Society and Politics poster [here](/files/polmeth25.pdf)**.

I am Joao Al√≠pio-Correa, a Ph.D. student in Political Science and an M.S. student in Statistics at the University of Pittsburgh. My research develops methods for causal inference under departures from standard identification assumptions. I focus on frameworks that relax independence and stability conditions, including settings with spatial or temporal dependence, interference between units, and other forms of structured heterogeneity. More broadly, I am interested in nonparametric theory, sensitivity analysis, and design-based approaches to strengthen causal claims in observational settings in the social sciences.

Beyond methodology, my applied work explores how regimes respond to stress. I study the political consequences of instability, with an emphasis on how sharp, acute events reshape political systems.
