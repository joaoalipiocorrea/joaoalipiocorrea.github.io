Hi, I’m João Alípio-Correa, a PhD student in Political Science and a MA student in Statistics at the University of Pittsburgh, specializing in political methodology and the breakdown of political regimes.

My methodological research focuses on advancing causal inference by addressing SUTVA violations and incorporating spatial-temporal interdependence under selection on observables. I am particularly interested in how spillovers between units and dependencies over time affect the application and interpretation of Synthetic Control Methods.

In the study of political regimes, my research examines political instability, with a focus on democratic breakdowns and failed coups d'état. I study the consequences of these rare and abrupt moments of instability, exploring how they transform regimes and reshape political systems.

Thanks for visiting—feel free to explore my work and reach out if you’d like to connect!
